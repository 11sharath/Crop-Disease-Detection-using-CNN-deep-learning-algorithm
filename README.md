Crop diseases can appear visually similar, making it difficult for non-experts to distinguish between them. Manual inspection can lead to delayed or incorrect diagnoses, 
causing lower productivity and increased pesticide misuse. Therefore, the aim of this project is to 
Develop a deep learningâ€“based image classification system capable of detecting and identifying crop diseases automatically from leaf images.
This system will:

Enable early and accurate disease detection.
Reduce dependency on expert analysis.
Support sustainable agriculture by minimizing chemical misuse.
Improve crop management and yield prediction.
